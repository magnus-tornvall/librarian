# OpenCode origin-qualification fixtures (§9)

Every new integration ships 3–5 golden content-events with expected outcomes (spec §9).
These are that surface for the OpenCode adapter: each file pairs a **native OpenCode
payload** with the **expected canonical event** the pure mapper
([`src/hook/opencodeMap.ts`](../../src/hook/opencodeMap.ts)) must produce. They are the
primary test surface — the mapping is proven here without an OpenCode runtime.

The runner is [`tests/adapters/opencode.test.ts`](../../tests/adapters/opencode.test.ts).
It **auto-discovers** every `*.json` in this directory: adding a fixture pair requires no
test-code edits (that is part of the Definition of Done). A "guard the guard" test fails
loudly if discovery finds fewer than 3 fixtures, so the suite can never go vacuously green.

## Fixture shape

```jsonc
{
  "name": "human-readable-case-name",        // required, unique
  "description": "what this case proves",     // optional, documents intent
  "native":   { /* NativePayload — the map() input */ },
  "env":      { /* MapEnv — injected event_id, ts, resource, context */ },
  "expected": { /* the canonical event map() must return (single event) */ }
}
```

`env` carries exactly the facts and stamps the real plugin resolves via I/O and injects
into the pure mapper — the ULID `event_id`, the ISO `ts`, the `resource` block, and the
`context`. Because the mapper is pure and the fixture injects fixed values, its output is
fully deterministic.

## Volatile fields excluded from comparison

Per §9, volatile fields are **excluded** from the stable-field comparison:

- **`event_id`** — a ULID, generated fresh per event by the live plugin.
- **`ts`** — the wall-clock timestamp, different on every real run.
- **machine-specific `resource` values** — chiefly **`resource.machine_id`**, which is a
  per-machine generated id (never the hostname), plus any host-specific path facts.

The runner asserts the mapper does **not invent or alter** these — it checks that
`event_id`/`ts`/`machine_id` in the output are exactly the injected `env` values (the
mapper passes facts through, it does not author them) — and then compares every remaining
**stable** field (`type`, `tool`, `command`, `files`, `hints`, `context`, and the
non-volatile `resource` facts) by deep equality. So a fixture's `expected` block still
spells out `event_id`/`ts`/`machine_id` for readability, but a change to those alone would
not fail a case; a change to a stable field would.

## Current fixtures

| File | Native signal | Proves |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ |
| `01-user-prompt.json`     | user prompt          | `PromptEvent`, raw prompt, full git resource. |
| `02-file-write-tool.json` | `write` tool         | `ToolEvent` file_write, `files[]`, file_write hint. |
| `03-git-commit-bash.json` | bash `git commit …`  | recategorized `vcs_commit`, raw command, vcs_commit hint. |
| `04-git-push-bash.json`   | bash `git push …`    | recategorized `vcs_push`, raw command, no hint. |
| `05-session-compact.json` | session compaction   | `SessionEvent` action compact. |
| `06-bash-stderr.json`     | bash with non-empty stderr | `outcome` carries BOTH streams — and **no hint**: stderr is not a failure signal. |
| `07-read-tool-drops-outcome.json` | `read` tool carrying an outcome | outcome capture is confined to `command`/`vcs_*` — a read maps with **no `outcome`**. |
| `08-bash-interrupted.json` | interrupted bash | the one honest failure signal → hint `command_failed`. |
